the right when watching a video, and the content that shows after a video has ended. Also hides links to the Home and 
Trending page.

## About
Websites such as YouTube are engineered to keep you on their site for as long as possible, which is not ideal when you 
are trying to be productive. We only have so many hours in a day and this extension may help you avoid those unwarranted 
but adorable cat videos we get absorbed into watching.

This extension removes distractions from YouTube. It hides the Recommended feed on the home page, the Related Videos 
feed that shows on the right when watching a video, and the content that shows after a video has ended. Also hides links
